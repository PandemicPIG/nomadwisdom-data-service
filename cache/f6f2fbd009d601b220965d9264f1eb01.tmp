Because a GH receptor exon 3 deletion (d3-GHR) appears to modulate GH sensitivity in humans, we hypothesized that this polymorphism could play a role in human longevity. We report a linear increased prevalence of d3-GHR homozygosity with age in four independent cohorts of long-lived individuals: 841 participants [567 of the Longevity Genes Project (LGP) (8% increase; P = 0.01), 152 of the Old Order Amish (16% increase; P = 0.02), 61 of the Cardiovascular Health Study (14.2% increase; P = 0.14), and 61 of the French Long-Lived Study (23.5% increase; P = 0.02)]. In addition, mega analysis of males in all cohorts resulted in a significant positive trend with age (26% increase; P = 0.007), suggesting sexual dimorphism for GH action in longevity. Further, on average, LGP d3\/d3 homozygotes were 1 inch taller than the wild-type (WT) allele carriers (P = 0.05) and also showed lower serum IGF-1 levels (P = 0.003). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the presence of d3\/d3 genotype adds approximately 10 years to life span. The LGP d3\/d3-GHR transformed lymphocytes exhibited superior growth and extracellular signal–regulated kinase activation, to GH treatment relative to WT GHR lymphocytes (P < 0.01), indicating a GH dose response. The d3-GHR variant is a common genetic polymorphism that modulates GH responsiveness throughout the life span and positively affects male longevity.","creator":"Ben-Avraham, D., Govindaraju, D.

Developing flexible and stretchable batteries with mechanical endurance that is on par with commercial standards and offer compliance while retaining safety remains a significant challenge.

This approach uses current collectors with enhanced mechanical design, such as helical springs and serpentines, as a structural support and backbone for all battery components. We show wire-shaped batteries based on helical band springs that are resilient to fatigue and retain electrochemical performance over 17,000 flexure cycles at a 0.5-cm bending radius. Serpentine-shaped batteries can be stretched with tunable degree and directionality while maintaining their specific capacity. Finally, the batteries are integrated, as a wearable device, with a photovoltaic module that enables recharging of the batteries.","creator":"Zamarayeva, A. M., Ostfeld, A. E., Wang, M., Duey, J.

For real-time analysis of metabolic flux in intact cells or organisms, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and imaging methods have been developed in conjunction with hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. These approaches enable noninvasive monitoring of tumor progression and treatment efficacy and are being tested in multiple clinical trials. However, because of their limited sensitivity, these methods require a larger number of cells, on the order of 10<sup>7<\/sup>, which is impractical for analyzing scant target cells or mass-limited samples. We present a new technology platform, a hyperpolarized micromagnetic resonance spectrometer (HMRS), that achieves real-time, 10<sup>3<\/sup>-fold more sensitive metabolic analysis on live cells. This platform enables quantification of the metabolic flux in a wide range of cell types, including leukemia stem cells, without significant changes in viability, which allows downstream molecular analyses in tandem. It also enables rapid assessment of metabolic changes by a given drug, which may direct therapeutic choices in patients. We further advanced this platform for high-throughput analysis of hyperpolarized molecules by integrating a three-dimensionally printed microfluidic system. The HMRS platform holds promise as a sensitive method for studying metabolic dynamics in mass-limited samples, including primary cancer cells, providing novel therapeutic targets and an enhanced understanding of cellular metabolism.","creator":"Jeong, S., Eskandari, R., Park, S.

The vapor-doped films have more than two orders of magnitude higher electronic conductivity () relative to solution-doped films. On the basis of resonant soft x-ray scattering, vapor-doped samples are shown to have a large orientational correlation length (OCL) (that is, length scale of aligned backbones) that correlates to a high apparent charge carrier mobility (μ). The Seebeck coefficient (α) is largely independent of OCL. This reveals that, unlike , leveraging strategies to improve μ have a smaller impact on α. Our best-performing sample with the largest OCL, vapor-doped PBTTT:F<SUB>4<\/SUB>TCNQ thin film, has a of 670 S\/cm and an α of 42 μV\/K, which translates to a large PF of 120 μW m<sup>–1<\/sup> K<sup>–2<\/sup>.

We experimentally involved members of German angling clubs (n = 181 in workshops, n = 2483 in total) engaged in self-governance of freshwater fisheries resources in a large-scale ecological experiment of active adaptive management of fish stocking, which constitutes a controversial management practice for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning when conducted inappropriately. The collaborative ecological experiments spanned several years and manipulated fish densities in 24 lakes with two species. In parallel, we experimentally compared changes in ecological knowledge and antecedents of proenvironmental behavior in stakeholders and managers who were members of a participatory adaptive management treatment group, with those receiving only a standard lecture, relative to placebo controls. Using a within-subjects pretest-posttest control design, changes in ecological knowledge, environmental beliefs, attitudes, norms, and behavioral intentions were evaluated. Participants in adaptive management retained more knowledge of ecological topics after a period of 8 months compared to those receiving a standard lecture, both relative to controls. Involvement in adaptive management was also the only treatment that altered personal norms and beliefs related to stocking. Critically, only the stakeholders who participated in adaptive management reduced their behavioral intentions to engage in fish stocking in the future. Adaptive management is essential for robust ecological knowledge, and we show that involving stakeholders in adaptive management experiments is a powerful tool to enhance ecological literacy and build environmental capacity to move toward sustainability.","creator":"Fujitani, M., McFall, A., Randler, C., Arlinghaus, R.","date":"2017-06-14T10:52:10-07:00","identifier":["info:doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.1602516","hwp:resource-id:advances;3\/6\/e1602516"],"publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","publicationDate":"2017-06-14","section":"Research Articles","volume":"3","number":"6","startingPage":"e1602516","endingPage":"e1602516"},{"title":"Mechanical deformation induces depolarization of neutrophils","link":"http:\/\/advances.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/3\/6\/e1602536?rss=1","description":"The transition of neutrophils from a resting state to a primed state is an essential requirement for their function as competent immune cells.

In reptiles, for instance, temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) is common. Despite decades of work, the mechanism by which temperature is converted into a sex-determining signal remains mysterious. This is partly because it is difficult to distinguish the primary molecular events of TSD from the confounding downstream signatures of sexual differentiation. We use the Australian central bearded dragon, in which chromosomal sex determination is overridden at high temperatures to produce sex-reversed female offspring, as a unique model to identify TSD-specific features of the transcriptome. We show that an intron is retained in mature transcripts from each of two Jumonji family genes, JARID2 and JMJD3, in female dragons that have been sex-reversed by temperature but not in normal chromosomal females or males. JARID2 is a component of the master chromatin modifier Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, and the mammalian sex-determining factor SRY is directly regulated by an independent but closely related Jumonji family member. We propose that the perturbation of JARID2\/JMJD3 function by intron retention alters the epigenetic landscape to override chromosomal sex-determining cues, triggering sex reversal at extreme temperatures. Sex reversal may then facilitate a transition from genetic sex determination to TSD, with JARID2\/JMJD3 intron retention preserved as the decisive regulatory signal. Significantly, we also observe sex-associated differential retention of the equivalent introns in JARID2\/JMJD3 transcripts expressed in embryonic gonads from TSD alligators and turtles, indicative of a reptile-wide mechanism controlling TSD.","creator":"Deveson, I.

To provide the most stable and effective interface, the tools of the trade must bridge the soft, ion-rich, and evolving nature of neural tissue with the largely rigid, static realm of microelectronics and medical instruments that allow for readout, analysis, and\/or control. In this Review, we describe how the understanding of neural signaling and material-tissue interactions has fueled the expansion of the available tool set. New probe architectures and materials, nanoparticles, dyes, and designer genetically encoded proteins push the limits of recording and stimulation lifetime, localization, and specificity, blurring the boundary between living tissue and engineered tools. Understanding these approaches, their modality, and the role of cross-disciplinary development will support new neurotherapies and prostheses and provide neuroscientists and neurologists with unprecedented access to the brain.","creator":"Rivnay, J., Wang, H., Fenno, L., Deisseroth, K., Malliaras, G.

It crosses the Atlantic Ocean twice during its life history, migrating between the spawning area in the Sargasso Sea and Europe, where it is widely distributed. The leptocephalus larvae drift with the Gulf Stream and other currents for more than a year and metamorphose into glass eels when they arrive on the continental shelf and move toward coastal areas. The mechanisms underlying glass eel orientation toward the coast and into freshwater systems are poorly known. However, anguillid eels, including the glass eel life stage, have a geomagnetic sense, suggesting the possibility that they use Earth’s magnetic field to orient toward the coast. To test this hypothesis, we used a unique combination of laboratory tests and in situ behavioral observations conducted in a drifting circular arena. Most (98%) of the glass eels tested in the sea exhibited a preferred orientation that was related to the tidal cycle. Seventy-one percent of the same eels showed the same orientation during ebb tide when tested in the laboratory under a manipulated simulated magnetic field in the absence of any other cue. These results demonstrate that glass eels use a magnetic compass for orientation and suggest that this magnetic orientation system is linked to a circatidal rhythm.","creator":"Cresci, A., Paris, C.

The erasing probe is a conically shaped hydrogel (tip size, ca. 500 nm) template-synthesized from track-etched conical glass wafers. The \"nanosponge\" hydrogel probe \"erases\" patterns by hydrating and absorbing molecules into a porous hydrogel matrix via diffusion analogous to a wet sponge. The presence of an interfacial liquid water layer between the hydrogel tip and the substrate during erasing enables frictionless, uninterrupted translation of the eraser on the substrate. The erasing capacity of the hydrogel is extremely high because of the large free volume of the hydrogel matrix. The fast frictionless translocation and interfacial hydration resulted in an extremely high erasing rate (~785 μm<sup>2<\/sup>\/s), which is two to three orders of magnitude higher in comparison with the atomic force microscopy–based erasing (~0.1 μm<sup>2<\/sup>\/s) experiments. The high precision and accuracy of the polymeric lithography editor (PLE) system stemmed from coupling piezoelectric actuators to an inverted optical microscope. Subsequently after erasing the patterns using agarose erasers, a polydimethylsiloxane probe fabricated from the same conical track-etched template was used to precisely redeposit molecules of interest at the erased spots. PLE also provides a continuous optical feedback throughout the entire molecular editing process—writing, erasing, and rewriting. To demonstrate its potential in device fabrication, we used PLE to electrochemically erase metallic copper thin film, forming an interdigitated array of microelectrodes for the fabrication of a functional microphotodetector device. High-throughput dot and line erasing, writing with the conical \"wet nanosponge,\" and continuous optical feedback make PLE complementary to the existing catalog of nanolithographic\/microlithographic and three-dimensional printing techniques. This new PLE technique will potentially open up many new and exciting avenues in lithography, which remain unexplored due to the inherent limitations in error rectification capabilities of the existing lithographic techniques.","creator":"Rajasekaran, P.

Common coinage metal electrodes pose fabrication and operational problems due to the high mobility of the surface atoms. We demonstrate how molecules covalently grafted onto mechanically robust graphite\/graphene substrates overcome these limitations. To this aim, we explore the effect of the anchoring group chemistry on the charge transport properties of graphite-molecule contacts by means of the scanning tunneling microscopy break-junction technique and ab initio simulations. Molecules adsorbed on graphite only via van der Waals interactions have a conductance that decreases exponentially upon stretching the junctions, whereas the molecules bonded covalently to graphite have a single well-defined conductance and yield contacts of unprecedented stability at room temperature. Our results demonstrate a strong bias dependence of the single-molecule conductance, which varies over more than one order of magnitude even at low bias voltages, and show an opposite rectification behavior for covalent and noncovalent contacts. We demonstrate that this bias-dependent conductance and opposite rectification behavior is due to a novel effect caused by the nonconstant, highly dispersive density of states of graphite around the Fermi energy and that the direction of rectification is governed by the detailed nature of the molecule\/graphite contact. Combined with the prospect of new functionalities due to a strongly bias-dependent conductance, these covalent contacts are ideal candidates for next-generation molecular electronic devices.","creator":"Rudnev, A.

Although scanned-probe measurements have provided crucially important microscopic insights into charge generation and transport in these blends, achieving the subnanosecond time resolution needed to directly observe the fate of photogenerated charges has proven difficult. We use a charged microcantilever as a gated mechanical integrator to record photocapacitance indirectly by measuring the accumulated change in cantilever phase as a function of the time delay between precisely synchronized voltage and light pulses. In contrast with previous time-resolved scanned-probe photocapacitance measurements, the time resolution of this method is set by the rise and fall time of the voltage and light pulses and not by the inverse detection bandwidth. We demonstrate in an organic donor-acceptor blend the ability of this indirect, \"phase-kick\" technique to record multiexponential photocapacitance transients on time scales ranging from 40 μs to 10 ms. The technique’s ability to measure subcycle, nanosecond charge dynamics is demonstrated by measuring the tens of nanosecond sample electrical charging time.","creator":"Dwyer, R. P., Nathan, S.

Instrumental and modeling data suggest that extratropical storm tracks may be intensifying and shifting poleward due to anthropogenic climate change, but it is difficult to separate recent trends from natural variability because of the large amount of decadal and longer variation in storm tracks and their limited instrumental record. We reconstruct cool-season, midlatitude Pacific storm-track position and intensity from 1693 to 1995 CE using existing tree-ring chronologies along with a network of newly developed chronologies from the U.S. Pacific Northwest, where small variations in storm-track position can have a major influence on hydroclimate patterns. Our results show high interannual-to-multidecadal variability in storm-track position and intensity over the past 303 years, with spectral signatures characteristic of tropical and northern Pacific influences. Comparison with reconstructions of precipitation and tropical sea surface temperature confirms the relationship between shifting drought patterns in the Pacific Northwest and storm-track variability through time and demonstrates the long-term influence of El Niño. These results allow us to place recent storm-track changes in the context of decadal and multidecadal fluctuations across the long-term record, showing that recent changes in storm-track intensity likely represent a warming-related increase amplified by natural decadal variability.","creator":"Wise, E.

We present comprehensive measurements, from three new field sites and three published studies, showing that characteristic saltation layer heights remain approximately constant with shear velocity, in agreement with recent wind tunnel studies. These results support the assumption of constant particle speeds in recent models predicting linear scaling of saltation flux with shear stress. In contrast, our results refute widely used older models that assume that particle speed increases with shear velocity, thereby predicting nonlinear 3\/2 stress-flux scaling. This conclusion is further supported by direct field measurements of saltation flux versus shear stress. Our results thus argue for adoption of linear saltation flux laws and constant saltation trajectories for modeling saltation-driven aeolian processes on Earth, Mars, and other planetary surfaces.","creator":"Martin, R.

The uppermost mantle and lower mantle contain little water because their dominant minerals, olivine and bridgmanite, have limited water storage capacity.

However, the actual amount of water in the MTZ is unknown. Given that water incorporated into mantle minerals can lower their viscosity, we evaluate the water content of the MTZ by measuring dislocation mobility, a property that is inversely proportional to viscosity, as a function of temperature and water content in ringwoodite and bridgmanite. We find that dislocation mobility in bridgmanite is faster by two orders of magnitude than in anhydrous ringwoodite but 1.5 orders of magnitude slower than in water-saturated ringwoodite. To fit the observed mantle viscosity profiles, ringwoodite in the MTZ should contain 1 to 2 wt % water. The MTZ should thus be nearly water-saturated globally.","creator":"Fei, H., Yamazaki, D., Sakurai, M., Miyajima, N., Ohfuji, H., Katsura, T., Yamamoto, T.","date":"2017-06-07T10:51:14-07:00","identifier":["info:doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.1603024","hwp:resource-id:advances;3\/6\/e1603024"],"publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","publicationDate":"2017-06-07","section":"Research Articles","volume":"3","number":"6","startingPage":"e1603024","endingPage":"e1603024"},{"title":"Deregulated Ca2+ cycling underlies the development of arrhythmia and heart disease due to mutant obscurin","link":"http:\/\/advances.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/3\/6\/e1603081?rss=1","description":"Obscurins are cytoskeletal proteins with structural and regulatory roles encoded by OBSCN.

We analyze changes in summer temperatures, the frequency, severity, and duration of heat waves, and heat-related mortality in India between 1960 and 2009 using data from the India Meteorological Department. Mean temperatures across India have risen by more than 0.5°C over this period, with statistically significant increases in heat waves. Using a novel probabilistic model, we further show that the increase in summer mean temperatures in India over this period corresponds to a 146% increase in the probability of heat-related mortality events of more than 100 people. In turn, our results suggest that future climate warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality, particularly in developing low-latitude countries, such as India, where heat waves will become more frequent and populations are especially vulnerable to these extreme temperatures. Our findings indicate that even moderate increases in mean temperatures may cause great increases in heat-related mortality and support the efforts of governments and international organizations to build up the resilience of these vulnerable regions to more severe heat waves.","creator":"Mazdiyasni, O., AghaKouchak, A., Davis, S.

Isostructural alloying is historically an extremely successful approach for tuning materials properties, but it is often limited by binodal and spinodal decomposition, which correspond to the thermodynamic solubility limit and the stability against composition fluctuations, respectively. We show that heterostructural alloys can exhibit a markedly increased range of metastable alloy compositions between the binodal and spinodal lines, thereby opening up a vast phase space for novel homogeneous single-phase alloys. We distinguish two types of heterostructural alloys, that is, those between commensurate and incommensurate phases. Because of the structural transition around the critical composition, the properties change in a highly nonlinear or even discontinuous fashion, providing a mechanism for materials design that does not exist in conventional isostructural alloys. The novel phase diagram behavior follows from standard alloy models using mixing enthalpies from first-principles calculations. Thin-film deposition demonstrates the viability of the synthesis of these metastable single-phase domains and validates the computationally predicted phase separation mechanism above the upper temperature bound of the nonequilibrium single-phase region.","creator":"Holder, A.

We show that they interact through their TOPLESS domains (TPDs) with two functionally important ethylene response factor–associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs of the rice strigolactone signaling repressor D53: the universally conserved EAR-3 and the monocot-specific EAR-2. We present the crystal structure of the monocot-specific EAR-2 peptide in complex with the TOPLESS-related protein 2 (TPR2) TPD, in which the EAR-2 motif binds the same TPD groove as jasmonate and auxin signaling repressors but makes additional contacts with a second TPD site to mediate TPD tetramer-tetramer interaction. We validated the functional relevance of the two TPD binding sites in reporter gene assays and in transgenic rice and demonstrate that EAR-2 binding induces TPD oligomerization. Moreover, we demonstrate that the TPD directly binds nucleosomes and the tails of histones H3 and H4. Higher-order assembly of TPD complexes induced by EAR-2 binding markedly stabilizes the nucleosome-TPD interaction. These results establish a new TPD-repressor binding mode that promotes TPD oligomerization and TPD-nucleosome interaction, thus illustrating the initial assembly of a repressor-corepressor-nucleosome complex.","creator":"Ma, H., Duan, J., Ke, J., He, Y., Gu, X., Xu, T.-H., Yu, H., Wang, Y., Brunzelle, J.

Despite some evidence of nontrivial surface states, the direct observation of the type II bulk Weyl fermions remains elusive.

The superelasticity and high strength, together with good electrical conductivity, of the graphene sponge imparted the graphene\/polymer hybrid films with fast recoverable shape-memory properties. Various droplets could slip on the compressed film with a lubricant-covered surface, but the droplets would be pinned when the shape-memory graphene film rebounded due to electrical stimulation, which caused the penetration of the infused lubricant into the pores and the exposure of rough topography film surfaces. The electrothermally dynamic tuning approach was stable and reversible; thus, the shape-memory graphene film was imparted with controlled slippery properties and functions that would be amenable to a variety of applications, such as liquid handling for microplates.","creator":"Wang, J., Sun, L., Zou, M., Gao, W., Liu, C., Shang, L., Gu, Z., Zhao, Y.","date":"2017-06-02T10:51:29-07:00","identifier":["info:doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.1700004","hwp:resource-id:advances;3\/6\/e1700004"],"publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","publicationDate":"2017-06-02","section":"Research Articles","volume":"3","number":"6","startingPage":"e1700004","endingPage":"e1700004"},{"title":"Capturing the radical ion-pair intermediate in DNA guanine oxidation","link":"http:\/\/advances.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/3\/6\/e1700171?rss=1","description":"Although the radical ion pair has been frequently invoked as a key intermediate in DNA oxidative damage reactions and photoinduced electron transfer processes, the unambiguous detection and characterization of this species remain formidable and unresolved due to its extremely unstable nature and low concentration.
